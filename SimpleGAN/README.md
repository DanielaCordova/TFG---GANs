# Definition of a Simple GAN

The structure of the GAN is as shown in the next image:

The parts that compose it are as follows:

- Training dataset: Dataset of real examples that we want to emulate with the Generator. It is the input to the Discriminator network.

- Random noise: vector Vector of random numbers used by the Generator to synthesize fake examples. It is the input to the Generator network. The changes in this vector are used in order to increase diversity on the images generated by the Generator Network.

- Generator network: This network takes in the random noise vector and outputs fake examples. Its goal is to generate fake examples as similar as possible to the real examples.

- Discriminator: network This network takes in a real example (training set) or a fake example (Generator). For each example, the discriminator determinates the probability of whether the example is real.

The main component is the Generator, which essentially plays the role of the artist who tries to copy the Mona Lisa, taking a random noise vector and producing a fake sample.

Additionally, the GAN includes a Discriminator playing the role of the art critic as it takes the image the Generator has produced and determines whether that image is real or produced by the Generator. Moreover, during the training process, the Discriminator learns what a real image looks like by processing real images taken from a dataset.
